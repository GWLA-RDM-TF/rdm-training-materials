# Research Data Management Training Materials

This repository is an aggregation point for a curated collection of *Research Data Management* educational and training materials. Each item in the collection is represented by a "card" that is based on a flavor of [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) that is supported by the [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html) processor. 

The HTML view of the card collection can be viewed at: [http:/GWLA-RDM-TF.github.io/rdm-training-materials](http:/GWLA-RDM-TF.github.io/rdm-training-materials)

# Research Data Management Training Materials

This repository is an aggregation point for a curated collection of *Research Data Management* educational and training materials. Each item in the collection is represented by a "card" that is based on a flavor of [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) that is supported by the [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html) processor. 

The HTML view of the resource collection can be viewed at: 
* [http:/GWLA-RDM-TF.github.io/rdm-training-materials/all-cards.html](http:/GWLA-RDM-TF.github.io/rdm-training-materials/all-cards.html)

The PDF representation of the resource collection cat be downloaded from: 
* [http:/GWLA-RDM-TF.github.io/rdm-training-materials/all-cards.pdf](http:/GWLA-RDM-TF.github.io/rdm-training-materials/all-cards.pdf)

----------------------

New resources can be added to the card collection by copying the `card-template.md` file in the `templates` folder and creating a new card with your choice of name in the `cards` folder. The selected name should contain no spaces and end with a `.md` extension. 

----------------------

If you have [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html) installed on your computer and have an operational `bash` shell environment, you can run the scripts in the `scripts` folder to regenerate the compiled HTML and PDF files that represent all of the registered resources.
